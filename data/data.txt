Session   Follow-up and monitoring mechanisms for the implementation of the DPoA at all level
Mr  Aniket Ghai  Senior Economy Affairs Officer of OHRLLS moderated the session  In his presentation on monitoring framework and plan to take it forward at a global level  he highlighted    the consistency between monitoring of the implementation of the DPoA and the 2030 agenda        alignment monitoring mechanisms with existing framework        support from UN country teams and country level teams of WB    World Bank   IMF    International Monetary Fund   and other multilateral institutions       enhancing systematic monitoring of the UN system and the interagency processes   and      support from the UN system and OHRLLS in terms of monitoring and follow-up  He emphasized the importance of monitoring at the national level and called for greater accountability of the UN and other international organizations and complementary monitoring at the regional and global level 
Mr  Ghai also listed three criteria for setting indicator in the monitoring framework    maximizing current statistic effort to avoid duplication        avoiding additional burden on national statistical offices and the UN entities   and      indicator that can be updated every one to three years and that are available for the LDCs  A few monitoring and implementation tools are already develop  such as the annual Secretary General  report on the implementation of the Programme of Action of the LDCs  accompanied by an online statistical annex   the Interagency Consultative Group    IACG  on LDCs  SDGs data  and other international recognized authoritative sources  The IACG on LDCs is drafting a monitoring framework for the DPoA with indicator for major target of the DPoA 
Mr  Bartholomew Armah  Chief  Economy Commission for Africa    ECA  made a presentation on the Integrated Planning and Reporting Toolkit    IPRT   The IPRT is a web-based planning tool that digitizes NationalDevelopmentPlan to facilitate performance tracking of NDPs    NationalDevelopmentPlan  and their alignment with global and continental framework  The IPRT seeks to map the relationship between the SDGs and the Agenda 2063  It includes performance tracking  intelligent dashboards  data visualization  and it generates reports and gives a diagnostic of results framework  IPRT has the following features     Horizontal alignment  It maps Agenda 2030 onto Agenda 2063 to identify synergies and areas of divergence at goal  target and indicator level        Vertical alignment  It assesses the degree of alignment at goal  target and indicator level  It maps financing framework onto development priority and provides a diagnostic of the results framework        Performance tracking  It tracks the performance of the NDPs and assesses gaps between actual performance and target  and it tracks budget commitments against national development target   and     Automated reporting  It generates reports on the alignment of both agenda with the NDPs and reports on NDP indicator performance against the target 
Mr  Armah noted that LDCs face the challenge of alignment multiple agenda coherently with their NDPs  He stressed the importance of alignment the NDPs with the SDGs and the Agenda 2063 and setting goals  target and indicator in the results framework 
The Integrated Financing Framework    INFFs  have four components     assessing and diagnosing the financing situation        development a financing strategy  Part of the financing strategy is to link the finances to development priority        monitoring and reviewing the strategy   and     governance and coordination 
Mr  Armah noted some cross-cutting challenge     the need to avoid alignment bias in favour of a few Agenda        the need to alignment beyond the goal level but also at the target and indicator level        the need to strengthen results framework to enhance performance tracking       the need to improve access to performance tracking data   and    the need to alignment budgets to DPoA priority  Mr  Armah shared the IPRT website and demonstrated various important tools of IPRT 
During Q&A  Sierra Leone raised the issue of biases towards the SDGs and how to forge synergies to   adequate funding for monitoring the implementation of the DPoA  The country also asked whether the ECA compares national budgets over time based on different currencies  and whether the toolkit has a currency converter built into its module  Mr  Armah explained that the biases can be mitigated  He used Uganda as an example where the ECA has conducted two analyses two years apart  There is an improvement in alignment after the second analysis  since the first analysis had shown the alignment in a more disaggregated way  There is a need to create evidence-based evaluations  and after that  the ECA can help country understand better why it is not alignment and what the country can do to improve the alignment  As to the national budgets  the information is provided in local currency  However  the country has the option to use the current exchange rate and convert the currency at any point in time 
Liberia was interested in which instrument a country should use  among goals  target  and indicator  to measure if a country is performing well in terms of alignment  Mr  Armah clarified that it depends on a country  objective  In fact  the target should be the ultimate objective of a country  whereas an indicator is a means that tells the country whether it has achieved that target  Burundi asked whether all Member States have access to the platform  or whether a country must sign up for it and put the data in the programme  Mr  Armah confirmed that the tool is freely available to all Member States  The ECA provided ongoing technical support to use the tool  Upon request  the ECA travels to the country and provides training to use the tool  After the training  the country has ownership of the part of the tool that is particular to the country 
Burkina Faso and Lesotho raised the issue of lack of indicator  Burkina Faso set up the IPRT in 2021  The country noted the challenge of monitoring the SDGs and the Agenda 2063 under the same tool  About 19 percent of indicator are not matched  Lesotho explained that the tool lacks target and indicator of many framework to measure and track the progress on the SDGs target  For example  the country  strategeic NationalDevelopmentPlan    NSDP  is set at the indicator level  However  about 39 SDGs target do not have corresponding indicator and most of the indicator are not disaggregated  This creates difficulties in measurement and alignment  This is due to a lack of data collection from all the LDCs  Mr  Armah explained that there could be a sequencing issue when implementation  both the SDGs and their five-year NationalDevelopmentPlan  The country should priority certain indicator in a year and move on with new ones in the next year since a country cannot focus on all indicator at once  In addition  the country needs to understand why it chooses a particular indicator and if there is room for convergence 
Togo asked whether ECA provides technical support for implementation  the tool and collecting data when a country submits a request  particularly when it comes to the indicator  Mr  Armah assured that ECA provides technical assistance in using the tool  and its Africa Centre for Statistics is also available to support country on data issues  He stressed the importance of data access and how to harness the available data in a more coordinated way  There may be more data available than the country think  The Africa Centre for Statistics of ECA can assist country with the data issues 
Bangladesh recognized that efficient follow-up and monitoring mechanisms at the national  regional  and global level are essential for the successful implementation of DPoA  The country is currently at the final stage of formulating a NationalDevelopmentPlan for implementation  the DPoA by alignment it with the SDGs  Each line Ministry or agency has nominated a single NFPs for both the SDGs and the DPoA to achieve a better alignment  The country has successfully implementation  the IPoA and achieved relevant SDGs target a few years back  and it is on track for graduation  It emphasized the importance of data for effective monitoring  LDCs lack reliable data  and they rely on UN agencies for training on selecting the right indicator to achieve their target 
Bhutan has integrated the DPoA into its long-term national development and the 13th NationalDevelopmentPlan  To achieve the desired results for these plan  the country employs a result- based management approach using the national key performance indicator  KPIs    Key Performance Indicator   outcomes  and output KPIs  On a yearly basis  these results are priority and translated into annual performance agreements  The NationalDevelopmentPlan must also undergo a mid-term review    every 2 5 years  and a terminal review    every 5 years  to assess the overall performance of the plan  The country noted that the country will keep strengthening the existing national M&E    Monitoring & Evaluation     Monitoring & Evaluation  system  and the strengthened system will monitoring and evaluate     the long-term plan and the 13th NationalDevelopmentPlan        the national policies   and      the regulatory assessments and evaluations  Bhutan  M&E system also faces a few shortfalls     Conducting extensive M&E is costly   and    There is inadequate national expertise  lack of reliable data  and insufficient usage of M&E lessons and recommendations 
Burkina Faso echoed the problem of lack of data  The country has set up an integrated financing framework which should be ready in the next month  However  when the country sets up a good monitoring system  it falls below their expectations for two main reasons     There is a linkage issue between the programme  budgeting  monitoring  and evaluation   and      If LDCs do not have the proper indicator  the country cannot monitoring properly on development progress 
Burundi is development its vision for  Burundi by 2040 and Burundi by 2060   and it is integrating the DPoA into this vision  While having an M&E mechanism for the national vision  the country has not development one especially for the DPoA yet  It explained that the monitoring mechanism is set at two level    a national coordinating committee for programme and development  which is led by the Prime Minister   and      sectorial ministries  With this follow-up mechanism  each ministry provides a report about how the vision is implementation  at the end of each year 
Central Africa Republic    CAR  has a weak capacity for an institutional response in the face of uprisings  Despite these hardships  CAR has been able to establish some programme to improve its situation  Currently  the country is going through a referendum phase and working on a new Constitution  People will vote on the new Constitution soon to establish a development policy  which will be crucial for resource mobilization and national solidarity to   a return to trust  security  and peace  The country called for    a transparent partner and open governance for national actors to think and act for change        an intelligent  creative  innovative  and consultative regional cooperation  Assistance for good governance is much needed in the country        improved digital access  connectivity and coherence of procedures across the country   and     mobilizing funds for public service projects 
Chad commended the support of the Africa Union  The country has benefited from capacity building  and it was able to establish its framework that includes a monitoring mechanism for both the Agenda 2030 and the Agenda 2063  As a result  the country only needs to create one monitoring report  and it considers both agenda when generating many other reports  This framework allowed the country to present its issues at a continental level and the High-level Political Forum on the topics of sustainable development  It also made the work more efficient and enhanced its capacity 
The Gambia is also trying to alignment its new NationalDevelopmentPlan with the DPoA  It is currently on hold since the UN is finalizing the Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework with the government  The Gambia has gone through the initiation phase in which it has presented the country context  The second phase is the planning phase  which is support by the UN country offices  In the third phase of the assessment  the country will present the detailed review results  For the final phase  the Gambia will establish a coherent link between Agenda 2030  the Africa Union  Agenda 2063  and other global processes  It also mentioned issues of productive capacity in areas of energy  infrastructure  telecommunication  science and technology 
Guinea-Bissau has also made efforts toward integration and alignment with NationalDevelopmentPlan since the adoption of Agenda 2030 in 2015  The challenge is to   the same NFPs who worked on the IPoA would also be working on the DPoA  Guinea-Bissau just went through an election  and it is necessary to convince the new government to adopt the same approach to   the integration  and have the same report used for the Agenda 2063  the SDGs  and for the DPoA
